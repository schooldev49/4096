inspired by 2048 (https://play2048.co/)

one of the first inspirations that did not use any of the original code : )

created with es6 OOP 

__overview__
<br>
<br>
modes are 循序渐近 - have to progress from one to the other
<br>
- easy mode - this mode is easy. you start on this mode. classic 4x4 layout, 1 spawn at once, 1/5 chance for a block to have double original value. this mode has hints that help you make good moves.
- hard mode - this mode is hard. 5x5 layout but 2 spawn at once. cannot merge multiple blocks at once (click on square to move).  blocks spawn in every 25 seconds. 1/21 chance for a block to lose half its original value
- impossible mode - this mode is impossible? block spawns are rigged to match the least favorable position. 6x6 layout. 2 spawn at once, whats impossible is math problems every 10 combinations :troll:, and a block spawns in every 10 seconds, 1/7 chance for a block to lose half its original value, 1/4 chance every 30 seconds that a AI will move for you randomly (trust your rng?)
- corrupted mode - ??? (secret mode, secret trigger in one of the modes)

<br>
pets - they automatically make a move every 15-30 seconds using AI assuming you made one other move, but make the game a "little" bit harder..? (WIP)
<br>
- unlock pets from beating ??? (and low drop from hard/impossible mode)
<br>
- trading system - must have beaten hard mode or above once to trade
