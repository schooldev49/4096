inspired by 2048 (https://play2048.co/)

one of the first inspirations that did not use any of the original code : )

created with es6 OOP 

__overview__
<br>
<br>
- easy mode - this mode is easy.
- hard mode - this mode is hard.
- impossible mode - this mode is impossible? block spawns are rigged to match the least favorable position
- corrupted mode - ???

<br>
pets - they automatically make a move every 15-30 seconds using AI assuming you made one other move, but make the game a "little" bit harder..? (WIP)
<br>
- unlock pets from beating ??? (and low drop from hard/impossible mode)
<br>
- trading system - must have beaten hard mode or above once to trade
